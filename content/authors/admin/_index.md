Greg Siemon is a chemical/process engineer with over 18 years experience in the downstream petroleum industry. With extensive experience in operations, project, supply chain and business/project economics, I have a strong track record of finding simple and low cost solutions to complex and cross business problems that have delivered sustained long term benefits. I have been leading teams for many years and have consistently received praise for the way that I mentor/develop my people and deliver results.

He is currently working to complete a PhD studying Enterprise-wide Optimisation (EWO) in Steelmaking at The University of Queensland. 

"Enterprise-Wide Optimization (EWO) is a new emerging area that lies at the interface of chemical engineering and operations research, and has become a major goal in the process industries due to the increasing pressures for remaining competitive in the global marketplace. EWO involves optimizing the operations of R&D, supply, manufacturing and distribution of a company to reduce costs and inventories. A major focus in EWO is the optimal operation of manufacturing facilities, which often requires the use of nonlinear process models. Major operational items include planning, scheduling, real-time optimization and inventory control. One of the key features in EWO is integration of the information and decision-making among the various functions that comprise the supply chain of the company."

While studying at UQ, he has been fortunate to be a member of the teaching team in a number of undergraduate and masters level courses including Unit Operations, Process Modelling & Dynamics, Integrated Safety Design and Management, Advanced Process and System Modelling and Whole of Process Optimisation and Control.
