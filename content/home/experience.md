  * Managed the Petrol and Avgas import and pipeline logistics during a 90 day shutdown of the Refinery in 2009. All products were imported during this time and it was the first time the refinery had been completely shutdown for that long. There were zero stockouts, zero product quality incidents and ship demurrage was significantly below plan. I successfully managed supply situation around a 10 day planned Geelong-Melbourne pipeline outage (pipeline normally transferred 10 million litres of product each day) with no impact on our customers.
  * Managed refinery schedules, pipeline and ship logistics for 4 grades of Diesel (specifications changed monthly), 3 grades of Petrol (specifications changed monthly), Jet Fuel, Avgas, 3 grades of Bitumen and 4 grades of Solvents with over 50 different feedstocks that changed every 3-4 days.
  * While acting Economics and Scheduling Manager, lead the team through an two week unplanned plant shutdown that occurred three days before Christmas. Continuously kept the wider business updated with stock projections while continuing to supply a much product as possible from the other production units that continued to operate at reduced capacity.

  * Successfully developed and commissioned project scope modifying part of a processing plant to allow refinery to comply with clean fuels legislation when construction of a new plant completion was delayed. This was completed in less than 12 months and started up schedule producing on spec product.
  * Provided production advice and support to a cross functional project team during successful development and implementation of Shell Optimax Extreme (VPower Racing) fuel. This was the first of its type in the world.
  * Lead development team that met the challenging requirements of the Refinery’s Environmental License implementing a project that reduced the emissions from key Refinery Tanks to better than World’s Best Practice.
  * Lead development team that successfully designed and commissioned minor plant modifications to allow the refinery to meet Government mandated reductions in the volatility of Petrol during Summer. The implemented project cost was slightly over $1 million. Several previous studies had concluded the only viable options would cost over $100 million.
  * Lead development team that allowed refinery to reduce the amount of Benzene in Avgas by 90%. This was done using a new formulation with less than $50 000 in plant modifications. The first batch of Avgas was produced on spec and on schedule and significantly reduced aircraft refueler’s Benzene exposure.
  * Lead team implementing Product Quality Giveaway system improvements. Substantial reduction in giveaway (making the product better than it needed to be) in 2007 on gasoline grades over previous years.
